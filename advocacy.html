          <h1>Enstill Value of Graphic Design Among Filipinos</h1>
          <p>Having been doing freelance graphic designing, getting commissioned works from clients internationally, and locally, and one thing I have noticed as I hunt for potential local clients, is that graphic design or designing computer graphics is not valued as it should be, like the foreign clients do. 
            Filipinos, not all, but mostly, don't really see the value and hard work it takes to create high quality designs. Most potential Filipino clients I have encountered was that they think it is an easy work, as you just use a computer, and they try to downplay it and offer a small price for it. 
            Especially in branding, visual identity, the logos, and such. I want to enlighten others and share value (knowledge that I have, and yet to learn) in graphic design among Filipinos. That graphic design in businesses and many sectors is important, it is part of your branding and makes you recognizeable and 
            memorable. If your business booms, what they will remember is the face of your brand, the logo. A simple graphic, yet so significant.
          </p>

          <p>Hence, my brand identity, 'krimydelight', with the goals to enlight, design and delight. Enlight. Share what I know to people, clients and aspiring Graphic Artists/Designers, and make my clients know what they really need as we go through the project. There are so many talented graphic artists in 
            the Philippines, and they end up going abroad as they are paid fairly there and their work is appreciated. Yes, there are notable businesses or companies here, in the Philippines, that value them, and as you can see, that's why they have grown to be successful, like McDonald's, Jollibee, KFC, and many more. 
            They know that branding is everything. We all have our own personal branding, and there is more to it than just a logo, it is the very personality we show. It is who we are. It is what makes us unique. And lastly, I design to delight, create satisfying designs; satisfying both the needs and wants of the client.</p>

            <p>But, I know I still have so many to learn, molding myself and make myself ready, one day build a platform for myself to share my advocacy and ambitions. I have yet to grow, and I will one day go out there, show myself to the world (online). Perhaps, become a YouTuber. This journey is yet to be explored.</p>
